Stand up today was with Neil, still a lack of information from other team members.
Neil gave me a youtube tutorial for a react website.
I had a driving lesson, which made me miss the guest lecture.
I filled in a trello (I have more permissions on Trello then Jira) for my personal project.
I worked on a few small piece of code.
