Today I worked mainly on my own learning outcomes. 
I looked at more React Native.
I know I personally need to work on my time management and work on commiting work every day instead of just randomly.
I don’t really know what I’m meant to be doing for the project so I have just been working on personal work instead.
I need to go back onto the Jira board and see what needs doing.
