I worked mainly on my own personal project, which is the start of a video game of some sorts. 
The team work had to be put on hold as I had no idea where the team was at nobody attended the standup apart from Timi who is new to the group anyway. This meant I had no way of progressing with the work as the Jira board hadn’t been updated and the ReadMe also hadn’t been updated. 
Working in groups in becomign increasing frustrating and annoying with an extreme lack of communication from several members.
