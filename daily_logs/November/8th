Today I attended the learning outcomes session on webex. 
I really need to catch up with learning outcomes. 
There are a lot that I think I can just bash out and not really worry about them. 
I also went into the session Bogdan decided to set up so he could set up the database. 
I also tried setting up a react native editor and it doesnâ€™t seem to be working so I will carryon with that tomorrow.
I also need to set up a timetable and start working more effiecently.
