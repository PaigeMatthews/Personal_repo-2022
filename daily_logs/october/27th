
Start time: About 11.40 after the Q&A session we had and the morning standup. Breaked at 1.30 until 5.30 for food and driving lesson

Before standup I had looked through everything I could on the slack channel to catch up after being away Wednesday until Monday.
Urls that I used for reference for homepage: 
https://www.nike.com/gb/
https://www.adidas.co.uk
https://www.jdsports.co.uk

The my main idea was looking at sport clothing pages/ high brand clothing pages.

I got a basic layout formatted, all of the pages have a very similar format. Depending on what we are selling I don't believe we will have that many internal pages. 

Nothing else to speak on.
