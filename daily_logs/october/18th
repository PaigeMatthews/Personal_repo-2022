
Today I had worked further on the hamburger element.
I add the dropdown bar and a 'mobile' function to allow it to appear when the screen is smaller than 500 pixels.
I spent a lot of time on the positioning of the dropdown as the links were overlapping.

We were meant to have a group meeting at either 1 or 4 but nobody responded to the message.
I responded by saying I didn't mind which time as I was free all day.
Will be further discussed in a relflection about communication.
