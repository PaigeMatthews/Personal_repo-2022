Today we had a bot of a set back as Jim had the files for the html and css but could not put them onto the team Repo this plus a lack of communication made it very hard to piece together the site.
I then managed to get in touch with Jim and we arranged to go over the site and add any pieces we were able to with the javascript and change some colour typing around.
We had a meeting to discuss this earlier and it had turned out nobody had done anything with the jira board and the back end hadn't even been started.

Today was quite frustating and we definitly have some lack of communication and participation.
