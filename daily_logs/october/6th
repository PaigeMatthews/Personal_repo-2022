Created a hamburger test.
Worked on Learning outcomes.
Finished a personal development plan.
Wrote up Enterprize Design Thinking. 
Worked on a new study timetable.
Fixed my repo (wasn't uploaded to the portal) 
Started a html file and javascript file for ecommerce.

Generally a little stressed I didn't realise how badly not uploading things as I was doing them would effect my workload. 
I need to work on how to upload pictures to certain folders unless I just link them to a cloud drive and not in the actual repo.
Also still need to work out how to upload code
