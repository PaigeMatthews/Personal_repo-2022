Threat analysis' allow for cyber security teams build and up keep effective threat models which give a well rounded view of the current state of cyber threats. 
But as threats are evolving with such speed, threat models are being developed to keep up with these changes but it is near impossible and every new piece of technology will have a certain amount of potential security risk that criminals will try to exploit. 
Threat analysis' can reduce the attack surface of the organisation by continually updating the identifiable threats. 
This hardens the security perimeter allowing the team to deal with less viable attack surface. 
Continuosly assessing threats via a risk management system will in turn result in an up to date risk profile that will improve the organisation's security posture and risk profiles can improve an organisations risk mitigation strategy. 
Threat analysis' are normally performed quarterly but this can vary from cybersecurity team to team and prganisation. 
Most often organsitations will hire a third party service to run these operations which can greatly reduce the need for internal resources to be used.
