### Eisenhower Timer
Made by Dwight Eisenhower before he became president. He served in the U.S Army during World War 2. It organises your task list into four separate quadrants. This sorts them using Not Important, Important, Urgent and Not Urgent.
Urgent tasks are those we feel need to get done immediately.
Important tasks are those that contribute to your long term goals or values.
Ideally you should only be doing the Important and Urgent tasks, you should delete or delegate.
Example:

The tasks in quadrant 1 should be done first, these are things that you should be doing straight away.
Quadrant 2 has essential tasks but they aren't immediate. These are things that should be scheduled.
Quadrant 3 need to be done but they don't have to be done by you.
Quadrant 4 is not important or urgent and can be deleted or ignored.

I personally don't think this would be a useful time management technique for me as a student. It feels like it would be more suitable for a leadership position in a work environment.

### Pomodoro Timer
Pomodoro Timers are frequently used throughout the "studying community". It is flexible time blocking in such a way that it allows for long periods of study with mandatory self care breaks. 
In a simple sense you get a to-do list and a timer, which is set for 25 minutes and focus on your first task for that 25 minutes then take a 5 minute break. Repeat this for 4 pomodoros and take a 15-30 minute break.
Break down complex projects: If a task requires more than four pomodoros it needs to be divided down further.
Smalls tasks go together: Any tasks that will take less than one pomodoro should be combined with other tasks.

This is a good technique for creative thinkers and people in school. 

### Time Blocking
From the moment you wake up, assign each time block in your day to a task. These tasks can be anything from eating breakfast to studying for a test. Dividing the day up and estimating how long it will take each task or timing each task to tell how much it will take.

### Getting things done
Capture the actions that have your attention. These are any tasks that can relate to anything going on in your life.
Clarify what these mean. Whether the tasks that have your attention are actionable or not. If the item is actionable, do it, delegate it or set it aside. If it's not actionable then ignore it for now.
Organise these actions and prioritise your to do list according to what you need to get done when.
Reflect and review the list of actions to determine your next priority. Cross off tasks and update the list.
Take the actions or smaller tasks you can complete right now.

### Rapid Planning Method
Capturing: Write down all of the tasks you need to accomplish this week.
Chucking: Chuck your tasks together by commonalities. Personal, school, career.
Create your blocks by making the task column and the result you want from completing that task and the purpose. list the actions to take to get there.
Create an empowering role for yourself to give yourself motivation. 

### Pickle Jar Theory
You have a pickle jar full of sand, pebbles and rocks. Sand at the bottom and rocks at the top.
The sand: This represents disrupting elements of your day, such as phone calls, text messages, emails etc
The pebbles: This represents your task that needs to be completed but can be done on another day or by someone else.
The rocks: These are the most important tasks that need doing that day.

Make a task list that starts with the rocks and ends with the sand. Use honest time estimate for each one and try to not plan more than the 6 to 8 hour work day.

### Eat that frog
Get clear on a a goal: what do you want to achieve most.
Write it down
Set a deadline
Compile a list of things you need to do to achieve your goal.
Organise this list in order of priority. These are your frogs and your most difficult tasks.
Take action, eat your nastiest frog first.
Repeat this cycle every day
