
Agile Program Fundamentals

Define the term 'programs' in a business context
Describe the programs pattern
Describe the discovery phase for programs
Describe the program funnel and release planning
Describe the wall of work and user stories
Describe the delivery phase for programs
Apply the Agile method to the programs and projects work you do that are repeatable processes whether that be family, school, job or other types of work

The programs pattern is the approach used to get project work done

Event > Discovery > Program Funnel > Delivery

The programs pattern is structured with the following phases; event, discovery, program funnel, delivery
The agile programs team consists of the same cross-functional empowdered team members as the operations team; however each program or project migt have a different number or levels of teams within the project

Agile is about doing the right work and doing the work right

Business:
A person who can speak to the business value of the work to be done
A sponser user who can speak on behalf of users
A techinical person who can speak to the techinical aspect of what is being envisioned
Client representation

Agile is about doing the right work as well as doing the work right
Agile can be incorporated into the program's way of working to empower teams to work smarter and faster and improve
Agile values and principles always apply to programs work
During the discovery phase, a small team works together to understand the problem, explore options for solving it, making sure the right people will be in place to complete the work and determine whether or not to mmove forward with the work.
The discovery phase empowers cross-functional teams to be more productive make smarter decisions and do better work, which is very motivating and ultimately makes the team happier.

Have a shared understanding of Agile through team training
Have a shared understanding of the project
Create the social contract
Create and refine the backlog
Identify epics, features and possibility stories
Set standards and guidelines
Define tools and enviroment
Identify the release plan

In Agile, the release plan is like a project map that allows the team to see the vision, direction, goals and expectations of the project.
The release plan includes the backlog, releases and iterations

During iteration planning sessions, Agile teams decide what stories they will work on a wall of work chart.

Levels of work:
Epics
Features
Stories, where are broken down into individual tasks

There are three levels of work in a project: Epics, features and stories
Epics are high-level activities that span multiple iterations and possiblity releases
Features are the proposed functionality but they are still too large to build
Stories have the tasks that are ready for the team to build

User stories are the smallest unit of work in the Agile framework
It is the work that the team can build and complete in an iteration
A story tells who the feature is for what it lets them do and what the value is to them
Acceptance criteria is specific to each story and lets the team know when the specific piece of work is done
The definition of done applies to all stories and refers to the standards that must be met for the story to be completed
During iteration planning sessions, Agile teams decide what stories they will work on a wall of work chart.

In delivery, Agile is used to run the project from start to finish.
The steps that makes up the Agile iteration cycle include the following: iteration setup, iteration planning, iteration backlog, pull work, back log refinement, execute work, daily standups, showcase and retrospective.
The Agile iteration cycle continues throughout the project amd allows the team to build and deliver the working iterations until the final agreed-upon product is fully delivered.
