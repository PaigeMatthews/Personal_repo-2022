In a couple of guest lectures Jenkins and Docker files were mentioned, this was mainly handled by the higher year students in the projects as they would be the ones doing the backend of the projects and making and implementing the servers. This means that due to the nature of the project layouts I personally do not have any kind of documentation to do with Jenkins. the projects that i was involved with tend to use HTML and CSS. The tools that were used and implemented were most commonly ones used within VSCode to allow for different langauges. I did however use plenty of version control throughout the course of making the healthy eating app, which was not complete and only had a working login page. While this project used version control and had several different versions there was no security measures put in place or seperate testing and documentation as it was difficult to understand what was asked of us when we were told to do this and a lot of conflicting information was given throughout when we asked for help.
