Cybersecurity is how organisations and indivduals reduce the risk of a cyberattack. It is most commonly used to protect the devices we all use and services we access from damage or theft or personal information that is stored on those devices. Cybersecurity stops criminals from accessing private information and using it neglectly or sharing it publically. Poor configuration of cloud services allows increasingly experienced cybercriminals to access and damage the data held within. Leaders can not solely rely on firewalls or antivirua software as cyber criminals become increasingly more efficent and resilient. 

This is why staff onboard should be educated on the more commonly seen cyber threats that could occur. Examples of this may include phishing, ransomware attacks or social engineering scams. It is getting increasingly more common to use AI to circumvent tradtional data security controls. This can be prevented by highly intelligent cloud security solutions and strong password policies. 

Data leaks could lead to identity theft as sensitive information like social security numbers, credit card information and bank account details are stored in cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive.
