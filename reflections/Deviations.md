When somebody is ill or has other work to do it can cause a deviation that slows or even temporarily stops the project. This has occurred in one of the first project some of the members where absent from the project and held vital information. This means that the rest of the team has to pick up and do extra work to meet deadlines to make up for loss of person. Deviations can also be caused when someone comes back to a project or is in the project part time and the project hasn't been fully explianed leading to tasks not being complete and people struggling to help with the project. This is when the team needs to schedule a meeting to allow the team to reconsile and try to fix the confustion that allowed for the deviation. Deviations can also come from unsuspecting changes in the project, this is to do with the changing of techonology, the changing of deadline or the fact that sometimes the critera changes or the immediate need for something changes and you have to switch the order to suit customer needs. These are all valid reasons for deviations that can affect timelines which have to be adjusted accordingly.
