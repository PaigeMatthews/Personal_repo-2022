Throughout the school year we were give group project work that we were told would fit into the Learning Outcoems that we had to achieve. As I go through the learning outcomes nearer the end of the year to gather evidence, I find less and less evidence that I have from projects that I have been doing throughout the year. These projects did not match the outcomes that we must pass to achieve the school year. This makes the projects seem poorly managed and thought out as in a couple of first year learning outcomes (LO1.2.1.5) asks us to use Jenkins or Docker files, which we briefly covered during a guest lecture it was not brought up during a project or as something we may have to achieve, this was soemthing the second years discussed using. The way that the projects are set and managed, with a lack of regard to the rubric makes the school year hard to accomplish and frustrating. The only thing the group projects taught me throughout this school year is that they don't work. People don't like to work together, get together to help one another and overall do not want to do the project work that is being asked of them. None of the projects that we did during the school year were finished or close to finishing due to the pure lack of interest from team members. This makes it an incredibly difficult and stressful enviroment to work in, which further ensured my reasoning to not further in this course.
