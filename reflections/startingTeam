I am unsure whether or not I am on the right course and unsure if I will continue this course next year as it has been very hard for me to get to grips with the course style and structure.

It becomes increasingly frustrated when you are given multiple areas of direction to the point where you are unsure of which to follow and when you follow one you are either thrusted onto a different one or told you shouldn't have been doing that in the first place.

The group projects are frustating with a lack of guidance from lecturers and senior students, or participantion from senior students at all.

This course feels more like a business course that it focusing on the Agile style more than actual computing.

While this course could possibly help me in the future, it was nothing simliar to my experience with working with a development team in my Foundation Appenticeship through West Highland College.

I am starting to feel more and more every day like this course does not suit how I learn, process information or will help me with further fields.

I don't particularlly feel like I am learning anything other than how to NOT run a software team, but I don't want to learn how to run a software team, I want to be in one, but I don't feel part of a team either.

The course structure feels messy with no true direction as to where I am going or what I should be doing.
