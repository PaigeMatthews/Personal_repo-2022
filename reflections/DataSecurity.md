While security was not implemented within the project the idea of security and the risks of security were discussed when planning and starting the healthy eating app. This would include how to properly store passwords and sensitive information that could be leaked. These would have to be stored in a secure server and would most commonly be hashed out and decryted anytime used within the code. Another method of storing this data would have been through a third party server, but this was proven to be hazardous due to the security risk of an insider threat which could lead to the information being leaked and exploited. It would be best to keep the information in a secure server that was encrypted to stop anyone from looking at it and allow only the person logging into the app to access this data. We could also keep all of the data stored on the device and not run the risk of transfering that to a different server but this could take up a lot of space. Cyber security is something to be taken very seriously so if this app would be deploid in would have to be discussed in depth. This is similar to a conversation that was had about credit and debit card security and why to use a third party was a safer option as you would have less impact on the banking security and could ensure that the information was stored and managed safely.
