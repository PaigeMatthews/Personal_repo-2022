Throughtout the time on the course we were made aware to take notes regarding the guest lectures. Several of these lectures I personally have missed because of work or other out of my hand situations but another thing I have come to notice is that some of the lectures are not recorded. Whether this be due to sensitive information being disclosed or other privacy issues. When attending these lectures I and several other students take notes throughout the lecture. Due to these lectures not being recorded could this sustain as a privacy issue. The lecturer does not want the potentially sensitive information to be kept in a video format for others to access, would, or rather should, these terms apply to the notes that the students take throughout the lectures and is this breaking cybersecurity. 

With regards to information surrounding cybersecurity that I have found, the answer should be yes, this breaches cybersecurity as this person did not consent to the information being widely available on the internet. This is then upheld by not recording the session and then later broken by the students who write and upload notes to their repos. While this is not necessarily the students fault, as they are just completing the notes their lecturers ask them to, it could be considered a breach of the guest speakers privacy.
