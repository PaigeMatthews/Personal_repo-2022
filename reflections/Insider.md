An Insider threat is defined as a current or former associate to an organisation that has authorised access and misuses this access to negatively influence importnat information or systems within a company. This can or cannot be an employee, it can also be a third party organisation, partner or contractor, practically anyone with access to a higher up position that tehy can exploit. The associate can either accidently cause harm or purposefully cause harm to the system or sensitive information withheld in the organisation. If this threat is unintentional it could be from an employee mistake to falling for a cybersecurity attack. If the threat is indeed intentional then it itself can be a cyber attack, including destruction of data or theft of data. The only problem with insider threats is that they are also considered the assest to the company, the people. The main problem with insider threats is they are harder to track if they are malicious as the person intends to hide what they are doing and already has access to the data they intend to corrupt or steal.
