While I did not have a chance throughout my school year to be able to use any kind of debugging analysis software, it was discussed several times and the benefits. Visual Studio Code has a built in debugging system which was often used throughout the course.
Checkstyle would have been my go to developmnent tool, but due to the type of project work that is done in first year, I didn't find any need to use any of these types of tools, seeing as until the very end of the year I hadn't used any kind of Java. 
While I hadn't been able to use this development tool I believe it would have been very helpful in making sure that I was working to the correct coding standard. Formatting seems to be a big part of the process of this tool and this would have been useful as it is one of the things that makes the coding process run smoother.
The system creates a running report of the code used and helps the developer improve the way they write the code.
