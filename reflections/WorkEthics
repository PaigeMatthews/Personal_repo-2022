We didn't finish the health application that we were assigned to do. This meant that we handed in an unfinished piece of work that was unsupplementary to the client's original brief. I feel this is due to a lack of communication and understanding of the project itself. The main problem with this is due to the lack of action that was taken by members of the project and the lack of additional action the rest of the members could prove to take. This is due to the fact that we had standups every morning which it was found that most members wouldn't turn up in to discuss the work they were doing and they didn't communicate in the Slack channel if they couldn't turn up to a meeting and if they couldn't turn up to a meeting; what they had done the day before and what they were doing on that day. The jira board stayed unupdated for several days at a time and due to the fact that first years could not update Jira boards it became increasingly difficult for people to remain on task. It also became hard for people to jump back into the project after having days off or even joinging the group as a new member.  After talking through this frustration with the lecturers I identified that I need to focus on what I could do and instead of waiting on everyone else I would do the parts that I could and hope that others followed suit. This would lead to me having a better understanding of the project and having done work allowing me to gain marks and evidence to better my portfolio. This means that even though my team was unco-operative and had a lack of end product as well as communication it means that I would still get marked on the work I had produced and allows me to reflect on the lack of information instead of trying to reflect on the abundence of information.
