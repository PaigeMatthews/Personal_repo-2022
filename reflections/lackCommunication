LO1.1.1.3:reflection

The lack of communication between teams has been extremely aggravating. It is wasting a lot of time which is slowing down production. 
The lack of communication in ReadMe files and in text in slack about what has been going on in the past couple of days that I have been in work is lacking.
I now have to work out how to set up the environment by myself and also the Jira board seems lacking in tasks that can be done without the necessary tools that come with the communication.
With everyone being in different industry settings and the only person joining the stand up being someone who has only just joined the group it has become increasingly hard to help with the team project.
Nothing can be done because there is no communication.
