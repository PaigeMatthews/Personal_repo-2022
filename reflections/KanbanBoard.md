Due to the fact that I was ill for two weeks during the project the front end of the project was put on hold until I came back. This meant that the kanban board, while still being used, has been used only by Cameron for the backend and the tasks haven't been picked up from the backlog as Cameron didn't feel it necessary to make a backlog. This is also due to the fact that neither of us have done anything using API before so we have been using the kanban board differently than what is traditional. The kanban board has been used more as a quick to-do list that as we are doing the task we put it into the kanban board instead of having a backlog of things we need to do as we don't have a clear view of what the project entails.

With the most part of the API set up, it will allow us to catch up on the front end, which will hopefully allow us to catch up to where we should be. With a lack of clear MVP the team has been working off of what we assume the project entails, which may be something we will need to discuss and clarify later.
