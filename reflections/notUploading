LO1.1.1.1: reflection

I hadn't uploaded any of my work or a very little amount of my work to my bitbucket repo and kept forgetting to do daily logs or reflections.

This led to me having to upload all of my work at once and remember what I had done on certain days to fill in gaps of my daily logs.

This became stressful and overwhelming when I realised how much work I hadn't done.

I think the main reason I felt stressed was because I didn't follow any kind of uploading schedule which caused me to fall behind.

So I'm going to impliment an uploading schedule and give myself reminds to do daily logs and reflections.
