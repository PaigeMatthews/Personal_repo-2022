I never had time to turn in my formative assessment.

This was due to a wide variety of factors, the Assessment was due on the 21st o October which was last Friday, including I was working Thursday afternoon/night, all **of** Friday and the entirety **of** the weekend.

The lecture on how to upload your assessment and the self assessment tool was on Thursday afternoon, which I was able to attend but had to go to work straight afterwards.

And the fact that the submission process **is** incredibly difficult to follow and achieve.

After spending time talking to other students and looking through the guides myself, it seemed very complicated compaired to most other submission processes.

This after time became frustating and confusing and due to the time restraint I left it **as** it was formative and I didn't have to hand it in.

Looking back I am really glad that I have a deadline **with** less **of** a time restraint **for** my formal assessment **in** Decemeber **as** the one **for** Friday was not given to us **with** enought time to hand **any** work **in**.

This **is** frustating due to the fact that i was aware that I would **get** more time to hand things **in** **as** it **is** a time consuming process and the lecturers seemed to be aware **of** how long it would take.
