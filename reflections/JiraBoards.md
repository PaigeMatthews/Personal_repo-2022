Throughout the school year we have been trying to use Jira boards. Most of the time these boards get left untouched after the first day or two and aren't touched again. This became a problem and became incredibly frustrating and hindered our progress throughout all of the projects. The Jira boards weren't being used, the tasks couldn't be broken down properly as most of us were unaware of how to properly break down the tasks and there was no guideance given on how to achieve this. This meant that the Jira boards would be poorly set up at the start of the sprint and not updated or progresseed throughout the sprints, which led to team members unsure of what had been done and what hadn't. What could have improved this is a proper deminstration from someone with more experience on how to break down tasks into soemthing more manageable and excutable. While Jira is a good system it is also more complicanted than that of Trello which would be better for people just starting to use these systems as the layout is more adaptable and user friendly, but still industry standard.
