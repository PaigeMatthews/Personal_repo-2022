Outlining goals, using SMART goals.

Specific - I want to get a portfolio setup and apply to some jobs.
Measureable - I want to have at least 5 small projects in the portfolio. Preferably with reasoning.
Attainable - Using GitHub, Youtube and VS Code to create a portfolio website.
Relevent - Yes, this is a realistic goal.
Time Bound - By the end of March.

My goals have changed over the last couple of months due to the fact that I got laid off from my current job and am looking for a new one, which isn't something I thought I'd have to do until after summer or further into my second year.
