I started using Notion on 07/11/2022, this Monday.
I stopped using Obsidion when I moved to Windows.
Mainly because I forgot to download it and then started just writing all of my reflections, dailys and note in Bitbucket.
Which is fine but I didn’t like the layout and it was just generally hard to write in. 

Obsidian was much the same. I didn’t really like the layout, I have a thing for making things look nice.
Aestitically pleasing some might say.
I just work easier when things are easy to look at and for me that means being able to customise it to look nice and easy navigation.
Designer at heart, probably from all of the art I did.

My main points about notion would be the fact that it acts more like a webpage then a note taking app, that is one of the bigger points that I like about it. One of the major things I don’t like about it is it doesn’t instantly connect to BitBucket but can connect to GitHub, which makes it difficult to use in a university sense, unless I can find another way of connecting them. I wasn’t really too bothered about how my notes connected to eachother in the mindmap style the Obsidian had.
I can see the breadcrumbs in my Notion and I feel it is easier to upload pictures into Notion.
